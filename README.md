<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Microsoft Deployment Toolkit is a software that deploys auomtatically WIM file (Windows 11 OS version) on desktops, laptops, and servers.
In my IT homelab, I actually did a IT class in-person project when I was at Utah Valley University. I knew how to create a boot image and setup DHCP server on the Domain Controller (Windows Server 2022 VM).
Here is screenshot I took. Firstly, I downloaded adksetup, adkwinpesetup, and Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (Workbench application) from the official Microsot website. Also, I have to download Microsoft Deployment Service
 on my domain controller, so it is for PXE network when I creat a Client Virtualmachine and it find the Ip address after setup DHCP scope.
